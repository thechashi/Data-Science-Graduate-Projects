# Data Preprocessing: Titanic DatasetIn this project, we preprocessed the Kaggle Titanic Dataset. We explored various data cleaning methods, including quick and dirty approaches as well as feature engineering techniques.### Highlights of the Project:- Initial quick and dirty methods:  - "Let's drop the Unknowns" approach dropped NaN values, resulting in a smaller dataset (mean accuracy of 0.76).  - "Does Identity Matter?" approach examined the impact of keeping the PassengerId column, which worsened results for SVM and RF models.- Adoption of the Gold Standard approach:  - Dropped PassengerID, Name, Ticket, and Cabin columns.  - Filled missing Age values with the median and used one-hot encoding for categorical variables.  - Achieved an average accuracy of 0.76 with this approach but dropped interesting variables.- Feature engineering:  - Extracted information from the Name and Cabin variables.  - Categorized names based on titles and obtained data on the number of cabins and deck levels.  - Accuracy improvement over the gold standard, except for RF model (mean accuracy of 0.78).  - Further fine-tuning, such as categorizing Age into bins and expanding title categories, led to SVM model accuracy of 0.81.- Importance of feature engineering:  - Feature engineering plays a vital role in achieving better results on the Kaggle dataset.- Effectiveness of ensemble models:  - Ensemble models, which average out predictions from multiple models, are effective in obtaining higher scores on Kaggle.## DataThe data for this project is located in the `data/` subfolder.
