# Cryptic Species Classification: SVMIn this project, we, Renata, Chashi, and Manikanta, aimed to utilize Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to identify two cryptic species of shellfish. Our goal was to develop a model that could classify specimens collected in the field without the need for expensive genetic analysis. We started by explaining the concept of SVMs and their functionality.Highlights of our project: SVMs (Support Vector Machines) are efficient supervised learning algorithms for classification.They find a hyperplane in an n-dimensional space to separate data points into two classes.Support vectors are crucial points for classification.Mathematical formulation of SVMs:Objective is to maximize the margin between hyperplanes and correctly classify training examples.Lagrangian multipliers used to solve the optimization problem and obtain weights and bias.Handling complex and non-linearly separable data:Slack variables added to SVM formulation to allow for misclassification.Trade-off between margin width and training errors improves model generalization.Transforming data to a higher dimensional space:Approach to achieve linear separability but comes with challenges and computational costs.Kernel trick allows calculation of dot products in the original input space.Different kernel functions (linear, polynomial, Gaussian) determine data point similarity.Application of SVMs to Yellow sandshell species classification:Linear SVM with primal problem achieved 97% accuracy in species richness survey.Key takeaways:SVMs can classify cryptic shellfish species effectively.Understanding mathematical foundations and practical considerations of SVM implementation is important.## DataThe data for this project is located in the `data/` subfolder.
