cerebellar infarct hemorrhage 4th ventricle occlusion. REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: compare to outside hospital MRI. No contraindications for IV contrast FINAL REPORT HISTORY: Cerebellar infarction hemorrhage fourth ventricle occlusion. Compared to outside hospital MRI. COMPARISON: No previous studies in PACS. The outside hospital MRI is not available for comparison. TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast head CT. FINDINGS: There is a large subacute infarction in the right cerebellar hemisphere which extends to the vermis with associated compression of the fourth ventricle. The lateral and third ventricles are dilated. Evaluation of the lower posterior fossa for hemorrhage is limited by bone related artifact and motion artifact. Small amount of blood may be present within the right cerebellar infarction. There is a chronic infarction in the left cerebellar hemisphere. There are multiple small foci of low density in the subcortical and periventricular white matter of the cerebral hemispheres bilaterally consistent with chronic microvascular ischemia. The visualized osseous structures appear unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1. Subacute right cerebellar infarction with compression of the fourth ventricle and moderate dilatation of the lateral and third ventricles. 2. Possible hemorrhage in the right cerebellar infarction. 3. When the outside hospital MRI is scanned into PACS an addendum to this report may be issued on request.
