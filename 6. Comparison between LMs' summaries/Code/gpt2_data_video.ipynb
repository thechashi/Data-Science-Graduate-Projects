Evaluate for effusions and infiltrates or cause for hematocrit drop. COMPARISON: CT of the chest . SINGLE AP UPRIGHT BEDSIDE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Compared to the CT and chest radiograph from one day prior there has been significant interval improvement of the right upper lobe opacity which may have been due to aspiration given its marked improvement. There is a new right infrahilar opacity which may represent pneumonia or hemorrhage. There is perihilar haze and indistinctness of the vasculature consistent with mild pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. IMPRESSION: 1. Improved right upper lobe opacity with new right perihilar opacity. This new opacity may represent pneumonia or hemorrhage given the patients hematocrit drop. 2. Mild fluid overload.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: compare to outside hospital MRI. No contraindications for IV contrast FINAL REPORT HISTORY: Cerebellar infarction hemorrhage fourth ventricle occlusion. Compared to outside hospital MRI. COMPARISON: No previous studies in PACS. The outside hospital MRI is not available for comparison. TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast head CT. FINDINGS: There is a large subacute infarction in the right cerebellar hemisphere which extends to the vermis with associated compression of the fourth ventricle. The lateral and third ventricles are dilated. Evaluation of the lower posterior fossa for hemorrhage is limited by bone related artifact and motion artifact. Small amount of blood may be present within the right cerebellar infarction. There is a chronic infarction in the left cerebellar hemisphere. There are multiple small foci of low density in the subcortical and periventricular white matter of the cerebral hemispheres bilaterally consistent with chronic microvascular ischemia. The visualized osseous structures appear unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1. Subacute right cerebellar infarction with compression of the fourth ventricle and moderate dilatation of the lateral and third ventricles. 2. Possible hemorrhage in the right cerebellar infarction. 3. When the outside hospital MRI is scanned into PACS an addendum to this report may be issued on request.
